# S8 Inprocode

## üìÑ Description

This project includes building a **Node.js API** with a **MySQL** database to store data generated by the project. Additionally, a React application will be developed with various interactive components such as a map, a calendar, and charts.

### Objectives

- Practice **Tailwind CSS** with React.
- Work with popular plugins.
- Build an API using **Node.js**.
- Develop a CRUD.
- Implement a map feature.
- Add a calendar feature.
- Create data visualizations with charts.

## üìê Project Structure

### ‚≠ê **Level 1**

#### **Exercise 1**
- Create a React project with a top menu that includes the following links:
  - **Home**
  - **Map**
  - **FullCalendar**
  - **Charts (Chart.js)**
- Develop the corresponding components and set up routing.

#### **Exercise 2**
- Create a real API in **Node.js** using a **MySQL** or **MongoDB** database.
- Develop a CRUD with a free theme. For example, a user CRUD.

#### **Exercise 3**
- Extend the API to manage data generated by the following components:
  - **Map**: Store a list of locations with latitude and longitude (using Mapbox).
  - **FullCalendar**: Allow adding and deleting events.
  - **Charts (Chart.js)**: Display two types of charts, such as a bar chart and a line chart.

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê **Level 2**

#### **Exercise 4**
- Evolve the map plugin:
  - Create categories for markers.
  - Add a category filter (using a dropdown or a list of checkboxes).  
  Example: If the markers represent restaurant locations, the filter could sort by cuisine type. Alternatively, points of interest in a city could be added.

---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Level 3**

#### **Exercise 5**
- Enable editing events in the calendar via a modal.
- Updated data must also be sent to the API.  
  Example: Users should be able to update the title, date, and time of an event via the modal.

#### **Exercise 6**
- Deploy the project to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel) and add the demo URL to the repository's README.

#### **Exercise 7**
- Ensure the quality of your code:
  - Perform a code audit using **SonarCloud**.
  - Fix any major issues identified during the audit.

- **Mapbox** for map integration.
- **FullCalendar** for event management.
- **Chart.js** for creating charts and visualizations.
- **SonarCloud** for code quality analysis.
